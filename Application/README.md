# Application
This application is used to demonstrate a part of the implemented functionalities in the libraries. There is also a test included.
This 'Test-Mode' can be activated by setting 'displayDebugInfo' to true; the application will then put all actions (fore- and background)
in the terminal. Since wether everything works or not is visible and hearable while using the application, and the libraries have tests as well, 
no more testing is required to test the functionality
